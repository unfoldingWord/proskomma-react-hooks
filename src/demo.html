                    together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, “First gather

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">31</span>&#160;He presented another parable to them, saying, “The

                    grow, it is greater than the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and
                    nest in its branches.” <span class="verses">33</span>&#160;He told them another parable: “The
                    kingdom of the heavens is like yeast that, having taken, a woman mixed with three measures of flour

                    <span class="verses">37</span>&#160;But answering, he said, “The one sowing the good seed is the Son

                    <span class="verses">16</span>&#160;But Jesus said to them, “They have no need to go away. You give

                    and John his brother, and brings them up onto a high mountain by themselves. <span
                        class="verses">2</span>&#160;And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the
                    sun, and his garments became brilliant as the light. <span class="verses">3</span>&#160;And behold,
                    there appeared to them Moses and Elijah talking with him. <span class="verses">4</span>&#160;But
                    answering, Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you desire, I will make here
                    three shelters—one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” <span
                        class="verses">5</span>&#160;While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed
                    them, and behold, there was a voice from the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
                    well pleased. Listen to him.” <span class="verses">6</span>&#160;And having heard that, the
                    disciples fell on their face and were very afraid. <span class="verses">7</span>&#160;And Jesus,
                    having approached and having touched them, said, “Get up and do not be afraid.” <span
                        class="verses">8</span>&#160;But having lifted up their eyes, they saw no one except only Jesus
                    himself.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">9</span>&#160;And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus
                    commanded them, saying, “Tell this vision to no one until the Son of Man might have risen from the
                    dead.” <span class="verses">10</span>&#160;And his disciples questioned him, saying, “Why then do
                    the scribes say that it is necessary for Elijah to come first?” <span
                        class="verses">11</span>&#160;But answering, he said, “Elijah indeed is coming and will restore
                    all things. <span class="verses">12</span>&#160;But I say to you that Elijah already came, but they
                    did not recognize him. Instead, they did whatever they wanted to him. In the same way also, the Son
                    of Man is going to suffer by them.” <span class="verses">13</span>&#160;Then the disciples
                    understood that he spoke to them about John the Baptist.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">14</span>&#160;And having come to the crowd, a man, having
                    approached him, is kneeling before him, <span class="verses">15</span>&#160;and saying, “Lord, have
                    mercy on my son, because he is epileptic and has sickness, for he often falls into the fire, and
                    often into the water. <span class="verses">16</span>&#160;And I brought him to your disciples, but
                    they were not able to heal him.” <span class="verses">17</span>&#160;But answering, Jesus said, “O
                    unbelieving and perverse generation, how long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you?
                    Bring him here to me.” <span class="verses">18</span>&#160;And Jesus rebuked it, and the demon came
                    out from him, and the boy was healed from that hour.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">19</span>&#160;Then the disciples, having come to Jesus privately,
                    said, “For what reason were we not able to cast it out?” <span class="verses">20</span>&#160;But he
                    says to them, “Because of your little faith. For I truly say to you, if you would have faith as a
                    mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and
                    nothing will be impossible for you. <span class="footnote"><span class="ft">Some ancient manuscripts

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">22</span>&#160;But as they are gathered together in Galilee, Jesus
                    said to them, “The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men, <span
                        class="verses">23</span>&#160;and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised
                    up.” And they became very upset.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">24</span>&#160;But when they had come to Capernaum, the ones
                    collecting the two-drachma tax came to Peter and said, “Does not your teacher pay the two-drachma
                    tax?” <span class="verses">25</span>&#160;He says, “Yes.” And having entered into the house, Jesus
                    spoke to him first, saying, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive
                    taxes or tolls? From their sons or from strangers?” <span class="verses">26</span>&#160;But when he
                    said, “From strangers,” Jesus said to him, “Therefore the sons are free.” <span

                    will find a shekel. Having taken that, give it to them on behalf of me and you.”</div>

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">1</span>&#160;At that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who
                    therefore is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?” <span class="verses">2</span>&#160;And having
                    called to himself a little child, he set him in the midst of them, <span
                        class="verses">3</span>&#160;and said, “Truly I say to you, unless you would turn and would
                    become like little children, you may certainly not enter into the kingdom of the heavens. <span
                        class="verses">4</span>&#160;Therefore, whoever will humble himself like this little child, he
                    is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens. <span class="verses">5</span>&#160;And whoever may
                    receive a little child like this in my name receives me. <span class="verses">6</span>&#160;But
                    whoever may have caused one of these little ones who believes in me to stumble, it is better for him
                    that a millstone of a donkey would have been hung about his neck and he would have been sunk into
                    the depth of the sea.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">7</span>&#160;Woe to the world because of the stumbling blocks! For
                    it is necessary that those stumbling blocks come, but woe to the man through whom those stumbling
                    blocks come! <span class="verses">8</span>&#160;But if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble,
                    cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than
                    to be thrown into the everlasting fire having two hands or two feet. <span
                        class="verses">9</span>&#160;And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it
                    away from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to be thrown into fiery
                    hell having two eyes. <span class="verses">10</span>&#160;See that you would not despise one of
                    these little ones. For I say to you that in heaven their angels always look on the face of my Father
                    who is in the heavens. <span class="footnote"><span class="ft">Some ancient manuscripts include

                    that which was lost.] <span class="verses">12</span>&#160;What do you think? If a certain man may
                    have 100 sheep, and one of them might have gone astray, having left the 99 on the hillside and
                    having gone out, does he not seek the one wandering? <span class="verses">13</span>&#160;And if he
                    may happen to find it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the 99 that have
                    not gone astray. <span class="verses">14</span>&#160;In the same way, it is not the will before your
                    Father who is in the heavens that one of these little ones would perish.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">15</span>&#160;But if your brother may have sinned against you, go
                    and reprove him between you and him alone. If he would listen to you, you will have gained your
                    brother. <span class="verses">16</span>&#160;But if he might not listen, take with you yet one or
                    two others, so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word might be verified. <span
                        class="verses">17</span>&#160;But if he might refuse to listen to them, tell it to the church.
                    But if he also might refuse to listen to the church, let him be to you even as the Gentile and the
                    tax collector. <span class="verses">18</span>&#160;Truly I say to you, whatever you may bind on the

                    <span class="verses">19</span>&#160;Again I truly say to you that if two of you might have agreed on
                    the earth about any matter that they might ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in the
                    heavens. <span class="verses">20</span>&#160;For where two or three are gathered together in my
                    name, there I am in their midst.”
                </div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">21</span>&#160;Then Peter, having approached, said to him, “Lord,
                    how often will my brother sin against me and I will forgive him? Until seven times?” <span
                        class="verses">22</span>&#160;Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you up to seven times, but up
                    to seventy times seven. <span class="verses">23</span>&#160;For this reason, the kingdom of the
                    heavens may be compared to a man, a king, who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves. <span
                        class="verses">24</span>&#160;And when he had begun to settle, one was brought to him, a debtor
                    of 10, 000 talents. <span class="verses">25</span>&#160;But, he not being able to repay, the master
                    commanded him to be sold, together with his wife and children and everything that he had, and
                    repayment to be made. <span class="verses">26</span>&#160;So the slave, having fallen down, was
                    bowing down before him, saying, ‘Master, have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.’
                    <span class="verses">27</span>&#160;But having felt compassion, the master of that slave released
                    him and forgave him the debt. <span class="verses">28</span>&#160;But having gone out, that slave
                    found one of his fellow slaves, who owed him 100 denarii, and having grasped him, he choked him,
                    saying, ‘Repay whatever you owe.’ <span class="verses">29</span>&#160;Then having fallen down, his
                    fellow slave begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will repay you.’ <span
                        class="verses">30</span>&#160;But he was not willing. Instead, having gone out, he threw him
                    into prison until he might repay what is owed. <span class="verses">31</span>&#160;Therefore when
                    his fellow slaves has seen what had happened, they were very upset. And having come, they fully
                    explained to their master everything that had happened. <span class="verses">32</span>&#160;Then,
                    having called him, his master said to him, ‘You wicked slave, I forgave you all that debt because
                    you begged me. <span class="verses">33</span>&#160;Was it not necessary for you to also have had
                    mercy on your fellow slave, just as I also had mercy on you?’ <span
                        class="verses">34</span>&#160;And having been provoked, his master handed him over to the
                    torturers until he might repay all that is owed. <span class="verses">35</span>&#160;In this way
                    also my heavenly Father will do to you, if each of you might not have forgiven his brother from your
                    heart.”

                    answering, he said, “Have you not read that the one who made them from the beginning made them male

                    married, commits adultery.” <span class="verses">10</span>&#160;The disciples say to him, “If thus

                    thus from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are
                    eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens. The one being able

                    them he said, ‘You also, go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.’ <span

                        class="verses">34</span>&#160;Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you, in this very night, before
                    the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” <span class="verses">35</span>&#160;Peter said to
                    him, “Even if it may be necessary for me to die with you, I will certainly not deny you.” And all
                    the disciples said likewise.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">36</span>&#160;Then Jesus went with them to a place called
                    Gethsemane and said to the disciples, “Sit here while, having gone over there, I may pray.” <span
                        class="verses">37</span>&#160;And having taken along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began
                    to be grieved and to be troubled. <span class="verses">38</span>&#160;Then he says to them, “My soul
                    is deeply sorrowful, to the point of death. Remain here and watch with me.” <span
                        class="verses">39</span>&#160;And having gone a little farther, he fell on his face, praying and
                    saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me. Yet, not as I will, but as
                    you.” <span class="verses">40</span>&#160;And he comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping, and
                    he says to Peter, “So, were you not able to watch with me for one hour? <span
                        class="verses">41</span>&#160;Watch and pray so that you might not enter into temptation. The
                    spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.” <span class="verses">42</span>&#160;Again, having
                    gone away a second time, he prayed, saying, “My Father, if this is not able to pass away unless I
                    may drink it, let your will be done.” <span class="verses">43</span>&#160;And having come again, he
                    found them sleeping, for their eyes were weighed down. <span class="verses">44</span>&#160;And
                    having left them again, having gone away, he prayed a third time, saying the same words again. <span
                        class="verses">45</span>&#160;Then he comes to the disciples and says to them, “Are you still
                    sleeping and taking your rest? Behold, the hour has approached, and the Son of Man is being betrayed
                    into the hands of sinners. <span class="verses">46</span>&#160;Get up, that we might go. Behold, the
                    one betraying me has approached.”</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">47</span>&#160;And as he is still speaking, behold, Judas, one of
                    the Twelve, came, and with him, a large crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and
                    elders of the people. <span class="verses">48</span>&#160;But the one betraying him gave them a
                    signal, saying, “Whomever I may kiss is him. Seize him.” <span class="verses">49</span>&#160;And
                    immediately, having come up to Jesus, he said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and he kissed him. <span
                        class="verses">50</span>&#160;But Jesus said to him, “Friend, for that which you are here.” Then
                    having come, they laid hands on Jesus, and seized him. <span class="verses">51</span>&#160;And
                    behold, one of those with Jesus, having stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and having struck
                    the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear. <span class="verses">52</span>&#160;Then Jesus says
                    to him, “Return your sword to its place, for all those who have taken up a sword will perish by a
                    sword. <span class="verses">53</span>&#160;Or do you think that I am not able to call upon my
                    Father, and he would send me more than 12 legions of angels at once? <span
                        class="verses">54</span>&#160;How then would the scriptures be fulfilled, that this must
                    happen?” <span class="verses">55</span>&#160;At that hour Jesus said to the crowd, “Have you come
                    out with swords and clubs to seize me, as against a robber? Every day I was sitting teaching in the
                    temple, and you did not arrest me. <span class="verses">56</span>&#160;But all this has happened so
                    that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples, having left him,
                    fled.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">57</span>&#160;But those who had seized Jesus led him away to
                    Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had been gathered together. <span
                        class="verses">58</span>&#160;But Peter was following him from a distance to the courtyard of
                    the high priest. And having entered inside, he sat down with the guards to see the outcome. <span
                        class="verses">59</span>&#160;But the chief priests and the whole council were seeking false
                    testimony against Jesus so that they might put him to death. <span class="verses">60</span>&#160;But
                    they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. But later two, having come forward, <span
                        class="verses">61</span>&#160;said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and
                    to rebuild it in three days.’” <span class="verses">62</span>&#160;And having stood up, the high
                    priest said to him, “Do you answer nothing? What is it that they are testifying against you?” <span
                        class="verses">63</span>&#160;But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, “I command
                    you by the living God, so that you might tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.” <span
                        class="verses">64</span>&#160;Jesus says to him, “You have said it yourself. But I say to you,
                    from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the
                    clouds of heaven.” <span class="verses">65</span>&#160;Then the high priest tore his robe, saying,
                    “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we still have need of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the
                    blasphemy. <span class="verses">66</span>&#160;What do you think?” But answering, they said, “He is
                    deserving of death.” <span class="verses">67</span>&#160;Then they spit in his face and beat him,
                    and they slapped him, <span class="verses">68</span>&#160;saying, “Prophesy to us, Christ. Who is
                    the one who struck you?”</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">69</span>&#160;But Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a
                    servant girl came to him, saying, “You were also with Jesus of Galilee.” <span
                        class="verses">70</span>&#160;But he denied it in front of them all, saying, “I do not know what
                    you are talking about.” <span class="verses">71</span>&#160;But when he had gone out to the gateway,
                    another girl saw him and says to those there, “This one was with Jesus of Nazareth.” <span
                        class="verses">72</span>&#160;And he again denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man!”
                    <span class="verses">73</span>&#160;But after a little while, those who had been standing by, having
                    approached, said to Peter, “Surely you are also one of them, for even your speech makes you
                    evident.” <span class="verses">74</span>&#160;Then he began to curse and to swear, “I do not know
                    the man,” and immediately a rooster crowed. <span class="verses">75</span>&#160;And Peter remembered
                    the words of Jesus that he had said, “Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.” And
                    having gone outside, he wept bitterly.

                    But they said, “What is that to us? See to that yourself.” <span class="verses">5</span>&#160;And

                    <span class="verses">7</span>&#160;But having taken counsel, they bought with the money the field of

                    from the blood of this man. See to it yourselves.” <span class="verses">25</span>&#160;And

                    the father of the child, having cried out, was saying, “I believe! Help me in my unbelief!” <span

                    this waste of the anointing oil happened? <span class="verses">5</span>&#160;For this perfume was
                    able to be sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor.” And they were scolding
                    her. <span class="verses">6</span>&#160;But Jesus said, “Leave her alone. Why are you causing
                    trouble for her? She did a good work for me. <span class="verses">7</span>&#160;For you always have
                    the poor with yourselves, and whenever you may desire you are able to do good to them, but you do
                    not always have me. <span class="verses">8</span>&#160;What she could, she did. She anticipated to
                    anoint my body for burial. <span class="verses">9</span>&#160;But truly I say to you, wherever the
                    gospel may be preached in the whole world, what she has done will also be spoken of, in memory of
                    her.”</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">10</span>&#160;And Judas Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve, went

                        class="verses">37</span>&#160;And he comes back and finds them sleeping, and he says to Peter,

                    answering, Jesus said to them, “Did you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to

                    bringing false testimony against him, saying, <span class="verses">58</span>&#160;“We heard him

                    days being tempted by the devil. And he did not eat anything during those days, and he was hungry
                    when they were completed. <span class="verses">3</span>&#160;Then the devil said to him, “If you are

                    were many widows in Israel during the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and

                    they led him to the edge of the hill on which their town was built, so as to throw him off. <span

                    rebuked him, saying, “Be silenced, and come out of him!” And the demon threw him down in their midst

                    one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. Then he sat

                    of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid; from now on
                    you will be catching men.” <span class="verses">11</span>&#160;And when they had brought their boats

                    if you are willing, you can make me clean.” <span class="verses">13</span>&#160;And he reached out

                    yourself to the priest and offer a sacrifice for your cleansing as Moses commanded, for a testimony

                    went up to the housetop and let him down through the tiles on his mat into the midst before Jesus.
                    <span class="verses">20</span>&#160;And seeing their faith, he said, “Man, your sins are forgiven

                    that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins,”—he said to the

                    amazement seized them all, and they glorified God, and they were filled with fear, saying, “We have

                    also spoke a parable to them. “No one, having torn a piece of cloth from a new garment, sews it onto

                    new. <span class="verses">37</span>&#160;And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. But if not,
                    the new wine will burst the wineskins, and it will be spilled out, and the wineskins will be
                    destroyed. <span class="verses">38</span>&#160;But one must put new wine into new wineskins. <span

                    wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. <span class="verses">45</span>&#160;You did
                    not give me a kiss, but from when I came in, she has not stopped kissing my feet. <span
                        class="verses">46</span>&#160;You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet
                    with perfumed oil. <span class="verses">47</span>&#160;Therefore I say to you, her sins, which were
                    many, have been forgiven—for she loved much. But the one to whom little is forgiven loves little.”
                    <span class="verses">48</span>&#160;Then he said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” <span
                        class="verses">49</span>&#160;And those reclining with him to eat began to say among themselves,

                    “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">4</span>&#160;And when a large crowd was gathering, and coming to
                    him by city, he spoke in a parable: <span class="verses">5</span>&#160;“The sower went out to sow
                    his seed, and as he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled underfoot, and the birds of
                    the sky devoured it. <span class="verses">6</span>&#160;And other seed fell on the rock, and when it
                    grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture. <span class="verses">7</span>&#160;And other
                    seed fell in the midst of the thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it. <span

                    produced fruit a hundred times greater.” After saying these things, he called out, “The one who has
                    ears to hear, let him hear.”</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">9</span>&#160;Then his disciples questioned him, “What is this

                    mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables, so that, ‘Seeing, they may not see;
                    and hearing, they may not understand.’ <span class="verses">11</span>&#160;And the parable is this:
                    The seed is the word of God. <span class="verses">12</span>&#160;And the ones along the path are
                    those who have heard, but then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so they
                    may not believe and be saved. <span class="verses">13</span>&#160;And the ones on the rock are those
                    who, when they hear, receive the word with joy. But they have no root; they believe for a time, and
                    in a time of testing they go away. <span class="verses">14</span>&#160;And the ones that fell among
                    the thorns, these are the ones who hear, but as they go on their way, they are choked by cares and
                    riches and pleasures of this life, and they do not produce mature fruit. <span
                        class="verses">15</span>&#160;But the ones on the good soil, these are the ones who, having
                    heard the word with an honest and good heart, hold it securely and bear fruit with endurance.</div>

                    he did not live in a house, but in the tombs. <span class="verses">28</span>&#160;And when he saw
                    Jesus, he cried out, fell down before him, and said in a loud voice, “What to me and to you, Jesus,

                    by the demon into the wilderness. <span class="verses">30</span>&#160;Then Jesus questioned him,

                    on the hillside, and they begged him to permit them to go into them. And he gave them permission.

                    they went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the

                    afraid. <span class="verses">36</span>&#160;Then those who had seen reported to them how the one who
                    had been possessed by demons had been saved. <span class="verses">37</span>&#160;And all the
                    multitude of the region of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, for they were seized by
                    great fear. Then he got into the boat to return. <span class="verses">38</span>&#160;And the man
                    from whom the demons had gone out begged him to be with him, but he sent him away, saying, <span

                    <span class="verses">40</span>&#160;And I begged your disciples so that they would cast it out, but
                    they were not able.” <span class="verses">41</span>&#160;Then answering, Jesus said, “O unbelieving
                    and perverted generation, until when will I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”

                    with convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his
                    father. <span class="verses">43</span>&#160;Then they were all amazed at the majesty of God. But
                    while all were marveling at everything that he was doing, he said to his disciples, <span

                    to him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. <span
                        class="verses">2</span>&#160;And answering, he said to them, “Do you think that these Galileans
                    were more sinful than all the Galileans because they suffered this? <span
                        class="verses">3</span>&#160;No, I say to you. But if you do not repent, you will all perish in
                    the same way. <span class="verses">4</span>&#160;Or those 18 on whom the tower fell in Siloam and
                    killed them: Do you think that they were worse debtors than all the men who reside in Jerusalem?
                    <span class="verses">5</span>&#160;No, I say to you. But if you do not repent, you will all likewise

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">6</span>&#160;Then he spoke this parable: “Someone had a fig tree
                    planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, but did not find any. <span
                        class="verses">7</span>&#160;And he said to the gardener, ‘Behold, for three years I have come
                    seeking fruit on this fig tree and have not found any. Cut it down. For what reason is it even
                    idling the ground?’ <span class="verses">8</span>&#160;But answering, he says to him, ‘Master, leave
                    it this year also, until I dig around it and put on manure. <span class="verses">9</span>&#160;If it
                    bears fruit in the coming one … but if not, you will cut it down!’”</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">10</span>&#160;And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the
                    Sabbath, <span class="verses">11</span>&#160;and behold, a woman having a spirit of weakness for 18
                    years, and she was bent over and was not able to straighten up to the complete. <span
                        class="verses">12</span>&#160;And when Jesus saw her, he called her over and said to her,
                    “Woman, you are released from your weakness.” <span class="verses">13</span>&#160;And he placed his
                    hands on her, and immediately she was straightened up, and she glorified God. <span
                        class="verses">14</span>&#160;But answering, the synagogue ruler, being indignant because Jesus
                    had healed on the Sabbath, said to the crowd, “There are six days on which it is necessary to work.
                    Therefore come and be healed on them, and not on the day of the Sabbath.” <span
                        class="verses">15</span>&#160;But the Lord answered him and said, “Hypocrites! Does not each of
                    you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it away to drink? <span
                        class="verses">16</span>&#160;But this one, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan bound,
                    behold, for 18 years, ought she not to have been released from this bond on the day of the Sabbath?”
                    <span class="verses">17</span>&#160;And as he was saying these things, all those who were opposing
                    him were put to shame, but the whole crowd was rejoicing at all the glorious things that were being
                    done by him.

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">18</span>&#160;Then he said, “What is the kingdom of God like, and
                    to what will I compare it? <span class="verses">19</span>&#160;It is like a mustard seed that a man
                    took and threw into his garden, and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the sky nested in
                    its branches.”</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">20</span>&#160;And again he said, “To what will I compare the

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">22</span>&#160;And he was traveling through cities and villages,

                    said to him, “Lord, if the ones who are being saved are few?” And he said to them, <span
                        class="verses">24</span>&#160;“Struggle to enter through the narrow door, because many, I say to
                    you, will seek to enter, but will not be able. <span class="verses">25</span>&#160;After the master
                    of the house gets up and closes the door, then you will begin to stand outside and to knock on the
                    door, saying, ‘Lord, open for us.’ But he will answer and say to you, ‘I do not know you, where you
                    are from.’ <span class="verses">26</span>&#160;Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank before
                    you, and you taught in our streets.’ <span class="verses">27</span>&#160;And he will speak, saying
                    to you, ‘I do not know where you are from. Get away from me, all you workers of unrighteousness!’
                    <span class="verses">28</span>&#160;In that place, there will be wailing and the grinding of teeth
                    when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you are
                    thrown outside. <span class="verses">29</span>&#160;And they will come from east and west and from
                    north and south and will recline to eat in the kingdom of God. <span

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">31</span>&#160;At that hour, certain Pharisees approached, saying to

                        class="verses">32</span>&#160;And he said to them, “Go and tell that fox, ‘Behold, I am casting
                    out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will be finished.’
                    <span class="verses">33</span>&#160;Nevertheless, it is necessary for me to journey today, and
                    tomorrow, and the following day, for it is not possible for a prophet to perish outside of
                    Jerusalem. <span class="verses">34</span>&#160;Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and
                    stones those who are sent to her! How often I have desired to gather your children the way a hen her
                    own brood under her wings, but you were not willing. <span class="verses">35</span>&#160;Behold,
                    your house has been left to you. And I say to you, you will certainly not see me until it comes when

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">1</span>&#160;And it happened that, when he went into the house of
                    one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, they were also watching him closely.
                    <span class="verses">2</span>&#160;And behold, a certain man who was edematous was before him. <span
                        class="verses">3</span>&#160;And answering, Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying,

                    silent. And, taking hold of him, he healed him and sent him away. <span
                        class="verses">5</span>&#160;And he said to them, “Of which of you will a son or an ox fall into

                        class="verses">6</span>&#160;And they were not able to give an answer to these things.
                </div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">7</span>&#160;Then he was speaking a parable to those who had been
                    invited, noticing how they were choosing the first places, and saying to them, <span

                    to eat in the first place, lest a more honorable than you may have been invited by him, <span
                        class="verses">9</span>&#160;and when the one who invited you and him arrives, he will say to
                    you, ‘Give your place to this one,’ and then you will begin with shame to take the last place. <span
                        class="verses">10</span>&#160;But when you are invited, go and recline to eat in the last place,
                    so that when the one who has invited you comes, he will say to you, ‘Friend, come up higher.’ Then
                    there will be glory to you before all those reclining to eat with you. <span
                        class="verses">11</span>&#160;For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">12</span>&#160;Then he also said to the one who had invited him,
                    “When you make a lunch or a supper, do not invite your friends, nor your brothers, nor your
                    relatives, nor rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and repayment happen to you.
                    <span class="verses">13</span>&#160;But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the
                    lame, and the blind, <span class="verses">14</span>&#160;and you will be blessed, because they do
                    not have to repay you. For it will be repaid to you in the resurrection of the righteous.”

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">15</span>&#160;And when one of those who reclined to eat heard these

                    they all from one began to excuse themselves. The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, and I
                    have need to go out to see it. I ask you, have me excused.’ <span class="verses">19</span>&#160;And
                    another said, ‘I have bought five pairs of oxen, and I am going to try them out. I ask you, have me
                    excused.’ <span class="verses">20</span>&#160;And another said, ‘I have married a wife, and because

                    reported these things to his master. Then becoming angry, the master of the house said to his
                    servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and
                    crippled and blind and lame.’ <span class="verses">22</span>&#160;And the servant said, ‘Master,
                    what you commanded has happened, and there is still room.’ <span class="verses">23</span>&#160;And
                    the master said to the servant, ‘Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them to come in, so
                    that my house may be filled. <span class="verses">24</span>&#160;For I say to you that none of those

                    his cross and come after me is not able to be my disciple. <span class="verses">28</span>&#160;For
                    which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and calculate the cost—whether he
                    has for completion? <span class="verses">29</span>&#160;Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and
                    is not able to finish, all who see it will begin to mock him, <span

                    20, 000? <span class="verses">32</span>&#160;But if not, while he is still far away, sending a
                    delegation, he asks the things for peace. <span class="verses">33</span>&#160;In the same way, then,
                    every one of you who does not renounce all the things that he himself possesses is not able to be my

                        class="verses">2</span>&#160;And he called him and said to him, ‘What is this I hear about you?

                        class="verses">4</span>&#160;I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from the

                    summoned each one of the debtors of his master, he said to the first one, ‘How much do you owe to my
                    master?’ <span class="verses">6</span>&#160;And he said, ‘100 baths of olive oil.’ Then he said to

                    heavens—and come, follow me.” <span class="verses">23</span>&#160;But he, hearing these things,
                    became extremely sad, for he was very rich. <span class="verses">24</span>&#160;Then Jesus, looking

                    said, “How difficultly those who have riches are entering into the kingdom of God! <span
                        class="verses">25</span>&#160;For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle

                    the ones who heard said, “Then who is able to be saved?” <span class="verses">27</span>&#160;Then he
                    said, “The impossible with men is possible with God.” <span class="verses">28</span>&#160;Then Peter

                    that he might know what they had gained by doing business. <span class="verses">16</span>&#160;Then
                    the first came and said, ‘Master, your mina has earned ten minas.’ <span

                    you, wicked servant! Did you know that I am a harsh man, taking up what I did not put down, and
                    reaping what I did not sow? <span class="verses">23</span>&#160;And for what reason did you not put
                    my silver in a bank, and when I returned, I would have collected it with interest?’ <span

                    and found it just as he had said to them. <span class="verses">33</span>&#160;And as they were
                    untying the colt, the owners of it said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?” <span

                    spreading their cloaks on the road. <span class="verses">37</span>&#160;And as he was already coming

                    toward peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes. <span class="verses">43</span>&#160;For

                    these farmers and will give the vineyard to others.” But when they heard this, they said, “May it

                    asked him, saying, “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and you do not receive a

                    one called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. And he came near to Jesus to kiss him. <span
                        class="verses">48</span>&#160;But Jesus said to him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man
                    with a kiss?” <span class="verses">49</span>&#160;And when those around him saw what was going to
                    happen, they said, “Lord, if we will strike with the sword?” <span class="verses">50</span>&#160;And
                    a certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. <span

                    ear, he healed him. <span class="verses">52</span>&#160;Then Jesus said to those who had come out
                    against him—chief priests and captains of the temple and elders—“Have you come out as against a
                    robber, with swords and clubs? <span class="verses">53</span>&#160;When I was with you each day in
                    the temple, you did not lay your hands on me. But this is your hour, and the authority of the

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">54</span>&#160;Then seizing him, they led him away and brought him

                    of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.” <span class="verses">59</span>&#160;And about one hour
                    having passed, a certain other one was insisting, saying, “In truth, this one was also with him, for
                    he is also a Galilean.” <span class="verses">60</span>&#160;But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what
                    you are saying.” And immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. <span
                        class="verses">61</span>&#160;And the Lord turned and looked at Peter, and Peter remembered the
                    word of the Lord, how he had said to him, “Before a rooster crows today you will deny me three
                    times.” <span class="verses">62</span>&#160;And going outside, he wept bitterly.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">63</span>&#160;And the men who were holding him mocked and beat him.
                    <span class="verses">64</span>&#160;And having blindfolded him, they were questioning him, saying,
                    “Prophesy! Who is the one who hit you?” <span class="verses">65</span>&#160;And they were saying
                    many other things to him, blaspheming him.

                    in all that the prophets have spoken! <span class="verses">26</span>&#160;Was it not necessary for
                    the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?” <span
                        class="verses">27</span>&#160;And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained
                    to them the things concerning himself in all the Scriptures. <span class="verses">28</span>&#160;And
                    they drew near to the village where they were going, and he acted as if he would travel further.
                    <span class="verses">29</span>&#160;And they urged him, saying, “Stay with us, for it is toward
                    evening and the day has already declined.” And he went in to stay with them. <span
                        class="verses">30</span>&#160;And it happened that, when he had reclined at the table with them,
                    taking the bread, he blessed it, and having broken it, he was giving it to them. <span
                        class="verses">31</span>&#160;Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he
                    became invisible from them. <span class="verses">32</span>&#160;And they said to one another, “Was
                    not our heart burning as he spoke to us on the way, as he opened to us the Scriptures?” <span
                        class="verses">33</span>&#160;And rising up that same hour, they returned to Jerusalem. And they
                    found the Eleven having been gathered, and those with them, <span
                        class="verses">34</span>&#160;saying, “Truly the Lord has been raised, and he has been seen by
                    Simon!” <span class="verses">35</span>&#160;And they related the things on the way, and how he was
                    made known to them in the breaking of the bread.
                </div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">36</span>&#160;And as they were saying these things, he himself
                    stood in the midst of them and said to them, “Peace to you.” <span class="verses">37</span>&#160;But
                    being frightened and becoming terrified, they thought they were seeing a spirit. <span
                        class="verses">38</span>&#160;And he said to them, “Why have you been troubled, and why are
                    doubts arising in your heart? <span class="verses">39</span>&#160;See my hands and my feet, that I
                    myself am. Touch me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see me having.” <span
                        class="verses">40</span>&#160;And having said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. <span
                        class="verses">41</span>&#160;And as they were still disbelieving and wondering from the joy, he
                    said to them, “Do you have something eatable here?” <span class="verses">42</span>&#160;So they gave
                    him a piece of a broiled fish, <span class="verses">43</span>&#160;and taking it, he ate it before
                    them.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">44</span>&#160;Then he said to them, “These are my words that I
                    spoke to you when I was still with you, that all the things having been written about me in the law
                    of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, must be fulfilled.” <span
                        class="verses">45</span>&#160;Then he opened their mind to understand the Scriptures, and he
                    said to them, <span class="verses">46</span>&#160;“Thus it has been written: The Christ would
                    suffer, and rise up from the dead on the third day, <span class="verses">47</span>&#160;and
                    repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in his name to all the nations, beginning
                    from Jerusalem. <span class="verses">48</span>&#160;You are witnesses of these things. <span
                        class="verses">49</span>&#160;And I am sending upon you the promise of my Father. But you stay
                    in the city until you put on power from heaven.”</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">50</span>&#160;Then he led them out as far as towards Bethany, and
                    lifting up his hands, he blessed them. <span class="verses">51</span>&#160;And it happened that,
                    while he was blessing them, he separated from them and was carried up into heaven. <span
                        class="verses">52</span>&#160;And they, having worshiped him, returned to Jerusalem with great
                    joy, <span class="verses">53</span>&#160;and they were through all in the temple, blessing God.

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">1</span>&#160;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
                    God, and the Word was God. <span class="verses">2</span>&#160;This one was in the beginning with
                    God. <span class="verses">3</span>&#160;All things came into being through him, and without him came
                    into being not one thing that has come into being. <span class="verses">4</span>&#160;In him was
                    life, and the life was the light of men. <span class="verses">5</span>&#160;And the light shines in
                    the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it. <span class="verses">6</span>&#160;There was a
                    man having been sent from God, whose name was John. <span class="verses">7</span>&#160;He came as a
                    witness in order to testify about the light, so that all might believe through him. <span
                        class="verses">8</span>&#160;That one was not the light, but that he might testify about the
                    light. <span class="verses">9</span>&#160;The true light, which gives light to all men, was coming
                    into the world. <span class="verses">10</span>&#160;He was in the world, and the world came into
                    being through him, and the world did not know him. <span class="verses">11</span>&#160;He came to
                    his own, and his own did not receive him. <span class="verses">12</span>&#160;But as many as
                    received him, to those believing in his name, he gave to them the authority to become children of
                    God. <span class="verses">13</span>&#160;These were not born from blood, nor from the will of the
                    flesh, nor from the will of man, but from God. <span class="verses">14</span>&#160;And the Word
                    became flesh and lived among us, and we have beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from
                    the Father, full of grace and of truth. <span class="verses">15</span>&#160;John testifies about him
                    and has cried out, saying, “This was the one of whom I said, ‘He who is coming after me has become
                    greater than I, for he was before me.’” <span class="verses">16</span>&#160;For from his fullness we
                    have all received even grace after grace. <span class="verses">17</span>&#160;For the law was given
                    through Moses. Grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ. <span
                        class="verses">18</span>&#160;No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten God, who is in
                    the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">19</span>&#160;And this is the testimony of John when the Jews sent
                    priests and Levites from Jerusalem so that they might ask him, “Who are you?” <span
                        class="verses">20</span>&#160;And he confessed—and he did not deny, but confessed—”I am not the
                    Christ.” <span class="verses">21</span>&#160;And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” And he
                    says, “I am not.” “Are you the prophet?” And he answered, “No.” <span
                        class="verses">22</span>&#160;Then they said to him, “Who are you, so that we may give an answer
                    to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?” <span class="verses">23</span>&#160;He said,
                </div>
                <div class="q">“I am a voice, crying out in the wilderness:</div>
                <div class="q">‘Make the way of the Lord straight,’</div>
                <div class="m">just as Isaiah the prophet said.” <span class="verses">24</span>&#160;And the ones who
                    had been sent were from the Pharisees, <span class="verses">25</span>&#160;and they asked him and
                    said to him, “Why do you baptize then if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the prophet?” <span
                        class="verses">26</span>&#160;John answered them, saying, “I baptize in water. In the midst of
                    you stands one you do not know, <span class="verses">27</span>&#160;the one coming after me, of whom
                    I am not worthy that I might untie the strap of his sandal.” <span
                        class="verses">28</span>&#160;These things came about in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John
                    was baptizing. <span class="verses">29</span>&#160;The next day he sees Jesus coming to him and
                    says, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who is taking away the sin of the world! <span
                        class="verses">30</span>&#160;This is he concerning whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who has
                    become greater than me, for he was before me.’ <span class="verses">31</span>&#160;And I did not
                    know him, but so that he might be revealed to Israel, for this reason I came baptizing in water.”
                    <span class="verses">32</span>&#160;And John testified, saying, “I saw the Spirit descending like a
                    dove from heaven, and it remained upon him. <span class="verses">33</span>&#160;And I did not
                    recognize him, but the one who sent me to baptize in water, that one said to me, ‘Upon whomever you
                    might see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, he is the one baptizing in the Holy Spirit.’
                    <span class="verses">34</span>&#160;And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.”
                </div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">35</span>&#160;Again, the next day, John was standing with two of
                    his disciples, <span class="verses">36</span>&#160;and having seen Jesus walking by, he said,
                    “Behold, the Lamb of God!” <span class="verses">37</span>&#160;And his two disciples heard him
                    saying this and they followed Jesus. <span class="verses">38</span>&#160;But Jesus, having turned
                    and having seen them following, says to them, “What do you seek?” And they said to him, “Rabbi
                    (which being translated means Teacher), where are you staying?” <span
                        class="verses">39</span>&#160;He says to them, “Come and you will see.” So they came and saw
                    where he is staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour. <span
                        class="verses">40</span>&#160;One of the two having heard from John and having followed him was
                    Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter. <span class="verses">41</span>&#160;He first finds his own
                    brother Simon and says to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which translated is: Christ). <span
                        class="verses">42</span>&#160;He brought him to Jesus. Jesus, having looked at him, said, “You
                    are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">43</span>&#160;The next day, Jesus wanted to go away to Galilee, so
                    he finds Philip and says to him, “Follow me.” <span class="verses">44</span>&#160;But Philip was
                    from Bethsaida, from the city of Andrew and Peter. <span class="verses">45</span>&#160;Philip finds
                    Nathaniel and says to him, We have found him whom Moses wrote about in the law, and the
                    prophets—Jesus son of Joseph, from Nazareth.” <span class="verses">46</span>&#160;But Nathaniel said
                    to him, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” Philip says to him, “Come and see.” <span
                        class="verses">47</span>&#160;Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and says about him, “Behold, a
                    true Israelite, in whom is no deceit!” <span class="verses">48</span>&#160;Nathaniel says to him,
                    “How do you know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under
                    the fig tree, I saw you.” <span class="verses">49</span>&#160;Nathaniel replied to him, “Rabbi, you
                    are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!” <span class="verses">50</span>&#160;Jesus replied
                    and said to him, “Because I said to you, ‘I saw you underneath the fig tree,’ do you believe? You
                    will see greater things than this.” <span class="verses">51</span>&#160;And he says to him, “Truly,
                    truly, I say to you, you will see the heavens opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending
                    upon the Son of Man.”</div>

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">1</span>&#160;And on the third day there was a wedding in Cana of
                    Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. <span class="verses">2</span>&#160;But Jesus also was
                    invited, and his disciples, to the wedding. <span class="verses">3</span>&#160;And the wine having
                    run out, the mother of Jesus says to him, “They have no wine.” <span
                        class="verses">4</span>&#160;And Jesus says to her, “Woman, what to me and to you? My hour is
                    not yet come.” <span class="verses">5</span>&#160;His mother says to the servants, “Whatever he
                    might say to you, do it.” <span class="verses">6</span>&#160;And there were six stone water pots for
                    the Jewish ceremonial washing standing there, each containing two or three metretes. <span
                        class="verses">7</span>&#160;Jesus says to them, “Fill the water pots with water.” And they
                    filled them up to the brim. <span class="verses">8</span>&#160;And he says to the servants, “Draw
                    now and take it to the head waiter.” And they carried it. <span class="verses">9</span>&#160;But
                    when the head waiter tasted the water that had become wine (and he did not know where it was from,
                    but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the head waiter called the bridegroom <span
                        class="verses">10</span>&#160;and says to him, “Every man serves the good wine first, and the

                        class="verses">11</span>&#160;This first sign Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and he revealed his
                    glory, and his disciples believed in him. <span class="verses">12</span>&#160;After this he and his
                    mother and his brothers and his disciples went down to Capernaum and they stayed there not many

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">13</span>&#160;And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went

                    and sheep and pigeons, and the money changers sitting there. <span class="verses">15</span>&#160;And
                    having made a whip from cords, he drove all of them out from the temple, both the sheep and the
                    oxen, and he scattered the coins of the money changers and overthrew their tables. <span
                        class="verses">16</span>&#160;And to those selling pigeons, he said, “Take these things away

                        class="verses">17</span>&#160;His disciples remembered that it is written, “Zeal for your house
                    will consume me.” <span class="verses">18</span>&#160;Then the Jews responded and said to him, “What
                    sign do you show us, since you are doing these things?” <span class="verses">19</span>&#160;Jesus
                    replied and said to them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” <span
                        class="verses">20</span>&#160;Then the Jews said, “This temple was built in 46 years, and you
                    will raise it up in three days?” <span class="verses">21</span>&#160;But he was speaking about the
                    temple of his body. <span class="verses">22</span>&#160;Therefore, when he was raised from the dead,
                    his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the scripture and this word that Jesus

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">1</span>&#160;Then there was a man from the Pharisees, Nicodemus was
                    his name, a ruler of the Jews. <span class="verses">2</span>&#160;This man came to him at night and
                    said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God, for no one is able to do
                    these signs that you do unless God is with him.” <span class="verses">3</span>&#160;Jesus replied
                    and said to him, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless someone would be born again, he is not able to
                    see the kingdom of God.” <span class="verses">4</span>&#160;Nicodemus said to him, “How is a man
                    able to be born when he is old? He is not able to enter a second time into the womb of his mother
                    and to be born, is he?” <span class="verses">5</span>&#160;Jesus replied, “Truly, truly I say to
                    you, unless someone would be born of water and the Spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom
                    of God. <span class="verses">6</span>&#160;That which has been born of the flesh is flesh, and that
                    which has been born of the Spirit is spirit. <span class="verses">7</span>&#160;Do not be amazed
                    that I said to you, ‘It is necessary for you to be born again.’ <span
                        class="verses">8</span>&#160;The wind blows wherever it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you
                    do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So is everyone who has been born of the Spirit.”
                    <span class="verses">9</span>&#160;Nicodemus replied and said to him, “How are these things able to
                    happen?” <span class="verses">10</span>&#160;Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you a teacher of
                    Israel, and yet you do not understand these things? <span class="verses">11</span>&#160;Truly,
                    truly, I say to you that we speak what we know, and we testify about what we have seen, and you do
                    not receive our testimony. <span class="verses">12</span>&#160;If I told you about earthly things
                    and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things? <span
                        class="verses">13</span>&#160;And no one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from
                    heaven—the Son of Man. <span class="verses">14</span>&#160;And just as Moses lifted up the serpent
                    in the wilderness, so it is necessary for the Son of Man to be lifted up, <span
                        class="verses">15</span>&#160;so that all who believe in him may have eternal life.
                </div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">16</span>&#160;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only
                    begotten Son, so that everyone who believes in him would not perish but would have eternal life.
                    <span class="verses">17</span>&#160;For God did not send the Son into the world so that he might
                    condemn the world, but so that he might save the world through him. <span
                        class="verses">18</span>&#160;The one who believes in him is not condemned, but the one who does
                    not believe has already been condemned because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten
                    Son of God. <span class="verses">19</span>&#160;But this is the judgment, that the light has come
                    into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their deeds were evil. <span
                        class="verses">20</span>&#160;For everyone who is doing evil hates the light, and does not come
                    to the light, so that his deeds might not be exposed. <span class="verses">21</span>&#160;But the
                    one who does the truth comes to the light so that his deeds may be evident, that they have been
                    worked in God.”
                </div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">22</span>&#160;After this, Jesus and his disciples went into the
                    land of Judea, and he tarried there with them and baptized. <span class="verses">23</span>&#160;But
                    John was also baptizing in Aenon near Salim because much water was there, and they were coming and
                    were being baptized, <span class="verses">24</span>&#160;for John had not yet been thrown in prison.
                    <span class="verses">25</span>&#160;Then a dispute came about from the disciples of John with a Jew
                    concerning ceremonial washing. <span class="verses">26</span>&#160;And they went to John and said to
                    him, “Rabbi, the one who was with you beyond the Jordan, about whom you had testified, behold, he is
                    baptizing, and they are all going to him.” <span class="verses">27</span>&#160;John replied and
                    said, “A man is not able to receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven. <span
                        class="verses">28</span>&#160;You yourselves testify to me that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’
                    but, ‘I have been sent before that one.’ <span class="verses">29</span>&#160;The one who has the
                    bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with
                    joy because of the voice of the bridegroom. Therefore, this joy of mine has been made complete.
                    <span class="verses">30</span>&#160;It is necessary for that one to increase, but I must decrease.

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">31</span>&#160;The one who comes from above is above all. The one
                    who is from the earth is from the earth and speaks from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is
                    above all. <span class="verses">32</span>&#160;He testifies about that which he has seen and heard,
                    but no one receives his testimony. <span class="verses">33</span>&#160;The one who has received his
                    testimony has set his seal that God is true. <span class="verses">34</span>&#160;For the one whom
                    God has sent speaks the words of God. For he does not give the Spirit by measure. <span
                        class="verses">35</span>&#160;The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.
                    <span class="verses">36</span>&#160;The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one
                    who disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God stays on him.”

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">1</span>&#160;Then when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that
                    Jesus is making and baptizing more disciples than John <span class="verses">2</span>&#160;(although
                    Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples were), <span class="verses">3</span>&#160;he left
                    Judea and went back again to Galilee. <span class="verses">4</span>&#160;But it was necessary for
                    him to go through Samaria. <span class="verses">5</span>&#160;Then he comes to a town of Samaria,
                    called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. <span
                        class="verses">6</span>&#160;And the well of Jacob was there. Then Jesus, having grown weary
                    from his journey, was sitting right beside the well. It was about the sixth hour. <span
                        class="verses">7</span>&#160;A Samaritan woman comes to draw water, and Jesus says to her, “Give
                    me to drink.” <span class="verses">8</span>&#160;For his disciples had gone away into the town so
                    that they might buy food. <span class="verses">9</span>&#160;Then the Samaritan woman says to him,
                    “How do you, being a Jew, ask from me to drink, being a Samaritan woman?” For Jews have no dealings
                    with Samaritans. <span class="verses">10</span>&#160;Jesus answered and said to her, “If you had
                    known the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked
                    him, and he would have given you living water.” <span class="verses">11</span>&#160;The woman says
                    to him, “Sir, you do not have a vessel and the well is deep. From where then do you have the living
                    water? <span class="verses">12</span>&#160;You are not greater, are you, than our father Jacob, who
                    gave us the well and drank from it himself, and his sons and his cattle?” <span
                        class="verses">13</span>&#160;Jesus replied and said to her, “Everyone who drinks from this
                    water will thirst again, <span class="verses">14</span>&#160;but whoever may drink from the water
                    that I will give him will never thirst forever. Instead, the water that I will give him will become
                    a fountain of water in him, springing up to eternal life.” <span class="verses">15</span>&#160;The
                    woman says to him, “Sir, give me this water so that I might not become thirsty and might not come
                    here to draw water.” <span class="verses">16</span>&#160;He says to her, “Go, call your husband, and
                    come back here.” <span class="verses">17</span>&#160;The woman answered and said to him, “I do not
                    have a husband.” Jesus says to her, “You have rightly said, ‘I have no husband,’ <span
                        class="verses">18</span>&#160;for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is
                    not your husband. What you have said is true.” <span class="verses">19</span>&#160;The woman says to
                    him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet. <span class="verses">20</span>&#160;Our fathers worshiped
                    on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary to worship.”
                    <span class="verses">21</span>&#160;Jesus says to her, “Believe me, woman, that an hour is coming
                    when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. <span
                        class="verses">22</span>&#160;You worship what you do not know. We worship what we know, for
                    salvation is from the Jews. <span class="verses">23</span>&#160;However, an hour is coming, and now
                    is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father also is
                    seeking such ones who are worshiping him. <span class="verses">24</span>&#160;God is Spirit, and
                    those worshiping him, it is necessary to worship in spirit and truth.” <span
                        class="verses">25</span>&#160;The woman says to him, “I know that the Messiah is coming (the one
                    called Christ). When he may come, that one will declare everything to us.” <span
                        class="verses">26</span>&#160;Jesus says to her, “I am, the one speaking to you.”
                </div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">27</span>&#160;And at this, his disciples came, and they were amazed
                    that he was speaking with a woman. Nevertheless, no one said, “What are you seeking?” or “Why are
                    you speaking with her?” <span class="verses">28</span>&#160;So the woman left her water pot, and
                    went back into the town, and says to the men, <span class="verses">29</span>&#160;“Come, see a man
                    who told me everything, as much as I have done. This is not the Christ, is it?” <span
                        class="verses">30</span>&#160;They went out from the town and came to him. <span
                        class="verses">31</span>&#160;In the meantime, the disciples were urging him, saying, “Rabbi,
                    eat.” <span class="verses">32</span>&#160;But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not
                    know.” <span class="verses">33</span>&#160;So the disciples said to each other, “No one brought him
                    to eat, did he?” <span class="verses">34</span>&#160;Jesus says to them, “My food is that I might do
                    the will of the one who sent me and might complete his work. <span class="verses">35</span>&#160;Do
                    you not say, ‘There are still four months and then the harvest comes’? Behold, I say to you, lift up
                    your eyes and see the fields, for they are already white for harvest! <span
                        class="verses">36</span>&#160;The one who is harvesting receives wages and gathers fruit for
                    eternal life, so that the one who is sowing and the one who is harvesting might rejoice together.
                    <span class="verses">37</span>&#160;For in this the saying is true, ‘One is the one sowing, and
                    another, the one harvesting.’ <span class="verses">38</span>&#160;I sent you to harvest what you
                    have not labored for. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”
                </div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">39</span>&#160;But many of the Samaritans from that city believed in
                    him because of the report of the woman, testifying, “He told me everything that I have done.” <span
                        class="verses">40</span>&#160;So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with
                    them, and he stayed there two days. <span class="verses">41</span>&#160;And many more believed
                    because of his word. <span class="verses">42</span>&#160;And they said to the woman, “We no longer
                    believe because of your speaking, for we ourselves have heard, and we know that this one is truly
                    the Savior of the world.”</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">43</span>&#160;But after those two days, he departed from there into
                    Galilee. <span class="verses">44</span>&#160;For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor
                    in his own country. <span class="verses">45</span>&#160;When therefore he came into Galilee, the
                    Galileans welcomed him, having seen all the things, as much as he had done in Jerusalem at the
                    festival, for they had also gone to the festival.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">46</span>&#160;Then he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had
                    made the water wine, and there was a certain royal official whose son in Capernaum was ill. <span
                        class="verses">47</span>&#160;Having heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to
                    him and asked that he would come down and heal his son, for he was about to die. <span
                        class="verses">48</span>&#160;Then Jesus said to him, “Unless you would see signs and wonders,
                    you would certainly not believe.” <span class="verses">49</span>&#160;The official says to him,
                    “Sir, come down before my child dies.” <span class="verses">50</span>&#160;Jesus says to him, “Go.
                    Your son lives.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went away. <span
                        class="verses">51</span>&#160;But while he was going down, his servants met him and reported to
                    him, saying that his son is living. <span class="verses">52</span>&#160;So he asked from them the
                    hour in which he began to improve. Therefore they replied to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the
                    fever left him.” <span class="verses">53</span>&#160;Then the father realized that it was at that
                    hour in which Jesus had said to him, “Your son lives.” And he himself and his whole household
                    believed. <span class="verses">54</span>&#160;But Jesus again did this second sign, having come from
                    Judea to Galilee.</div>

                    is the man who said to you, ‘Pick it up and walk’?” <span class="verses">13</span>&#160;But the one
                    who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had gone away secretly, a crowd being in the
                    place. <span class="verses">14</span>&#160;After this, Jesus finds him in the temple and said to
                    him, “Behold, you have become healthy! No longer sin, so that something worse might not happen to
                    you.” <span class="verses">15</span>&#160;The man went away and announced to the Jews that it was
                    Jesus who had made him healthy. <span class="verses">16</span>&#160;And because of these things the
                    Jews began to persecute Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath. <span
                        class="verses">17</span>&#160;But he replied to them, “My Father is working even now, and I am
                    working.” <span class="verses">18</span>&#160;Because of this, therefore, the Jews sought even more
                    to kill him because he not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God his own Father,
                    making himself equal to God.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">19</span>&#160;Therefore Jesus answered and said to them, “Truly,
                    truly I say to you, the Son is able to do nothing of himself, except only what he would see the
                    Father doing, for whatever that one would do, these things also the Son does as well. <span
                        class="verses">20</span>&#160;For the Father loves the Son and he shows him everything that he
                    himself does, and he will show him greater works than these so that you might be amazed. <span
                        class="verses">21</span>&#160;For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so
                    also the Son gives life to whom he desires. <span class="verses">22</span>&#160;For not even the
                    Father judges anyone, but he has given all judgment to the Son <span
                        class="verses">23</span>&#160;so that all will honor the Son just as they honor the Father. The
                    one not honoring the Son does not honor the Father who has sent him. <span
                        class="verses">24</span>&#160;Truly, truly I say to you that the one hearing my word and
                    believing the one who has sent me has eternal life and does not come into judgment, but he has
                    passed from death to life. <span class="verses">25</span>&#160;Truly, truly, I say to you that an
                    hour is coming, and is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who have
                    heard will live. <span class="verses">26</span>&#160;For just as the Father has life in himself, so
                    also he gave to the Son to have life in himself, <span class="verses">27</span>&#160;and he gave the
                    Son authority to do judgment because he is the Son of Man. <span class="verses">28</span>&#160;Do
                    not be amazed at this, for an hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice
                    <span class="verses">29</span>&#160;and will come out—those who have done good to a resurrection of
                    life, but those who have practiced evil to a resurrection of judgment.

                    I judge, and my judgment is righteous because I do not seek my own will but the will of the one who
                    has sent me. <span class="verses">31</span>&#160;If I would testify about myself, my testimony is

                    have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth. <span class="verses">34</span>&#160;But I do
                    not receive the testimony from man. But I say these things so that you might be saved. <span

                    is greater than that of John, for the works that the Father has given me so that I would accomplish
                    them, the very works that I do, testify about me that the Father has sent me. <span
                        class="verses">37</span>&#160;And the Father who sent me has himself testified about me. You

                    because you think that in them you have eternal life, and these are the ones testifying about me,

                    life. <span class="verses">41</span>&#160;I do not receive glory from men, <span

                    receive me. If another would come in his own name, you would receive him. <span
                        class="verses">44</span>&#160;How are you able to believe glory you are receiving from one

                        class="verses">45</span>&#160;Do not think that I myself will accuse you before the Father. The
                    one accusing you is Moses, in whom you have put your hope. <span class="verses">46</span>&#160;For
                    if you believed Moses, you would believe me, because he wrote about me. <span

                    of the Sea of Galilee (of Tiberias). <span class="verses">2</span>&#160;But a great crowd was
                    following him because they saw the signs that he was doing on those being sick. <span

                    <span class="verses">5</span>&#160;Therefore Jesus, having lifted up his eyes and having seen that a
                    great crowd was coming to him, says to Philip, “From where might we buy bread so that these might
                    eat?” <span class="verses">6</span>&#160;(But he said this, testing Philip, for he himself knew what

                    bread is not sufficient for them, so that each one might receive a little.” <span

                    barley and two small fish, but what are these to so many?” <span class="verses">10</span>&#160;Jesus
                    said, “Make the men sit down.” (But there was a lot of grass in the place.) So the men sat down,
                    about 5, 000 in number. <span class="verses">11</span>&#160;Then Jesus took the loaves and having
                    given thanks, he gave it to those sitting; likewise also with the fish, as much as they wanted.
                    <span class="verses">12</span>&#160;But as they were filled, he said to his disciples, “Gather up
                    the remaining broken pieces, so that nothing might be lost.” <span class="verses">13</span>&#160;So
                    they gathered them up and filled 12 baskets of broken pieces from the five barley loaves which were
                    left over by those who had eaten. <span class="verses">14</span>&#160;Then the men, having seen sign
                    he did, said, “This truly is the prophet who is coming into the world.” <span

                    therefore the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples are there, they themselves got into the

                    on the other side of the sea, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?” <span
                        class="verses">26</span>&#160;Jesus replied to them and said, “Truly, truly I say to you, you

                        class="verses">27</span>&#160;Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that

                    him.” <span class="verses">28</span>&#160;Then they said to him, “What should we do, so that we
                    might work the works of God?” <span class="verses">29</span>&#160;Jesus replied and said to them,

                        class="verses">30</span>&#160;So they said to him, “What sign then do you do, so that we might
                    see and might believe you? What will you work? <span class="verses">31</span>&#160;Our fathers ate

                    thirst. <span class="verses">36</span>&#160;But I told you that indeed you have seen me, and you do

                    have come down from heaven, not in order that I might do my own will, but the will of the one who
                    sent me. <span class="verses">39</span>&#160;But this is the will of the one who sent me, that I

                    Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless you would eat the flesh of the Son of Man and

                    the Jews were looking for him at the festival and saying, “Where is he?” <span
                        class="verses">12</span>&#160;And there was much grumbling among the crowds about him. Some were

                    marveled, saying, “How does this one know the scriptures, not being educated?” <span
                        class="verses">16</span>&#160;Then Jesus answered them and said, “My teaching is not mine, but

                    given you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and on the Sabbath you
                    circumcise a man. <span class="verses">23</span>&#160;If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath
                    so that the law of Moses might not be broken, why are you angry with me because I made a man

                    the crowds murmuring these things about him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers
                    so that they might arrest him. <span class="verses">33</span>&#160;Jesus then said, “I am still with
                    you for a short time, and then I go to the one who sent me. <span class="verses">34</span>&#160;You
                    will seek me but you will not find me, and where I am, you will not be able to come.” <span
                        class="verses">35</span>&#160;The Jews therefore said among themselves, “Where is this man about
                    to go that we will not find him? He is not about to go to the dispersion of the Greeks and to teach
                    the Greeks, is he? <span class="verses">36</span>&#160;What is this word that he said, ‘You will
                    seek me but will not find me, and where I am, you will not be able to come’?”</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">37</span>&#160;But on the last, great day of the festival, Jesus
                    stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone may thirst, let him come to me and drink. <span
                        class="verses">38</span>&#160;The one believing in me, just as the scripture says, rivers of
                    living water will flow from his stomach.” <span class="verses">39</span>&#160;But he said this about
                    the Spirit, whom those who had believed in him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet
                    because Jesus had not yet been glorified. <span class="verses">40</span>&#160;Therefore some from
                    the crowd, having heard these words, said, “This is truly the prophet.” <span
                        class="verses">41</span>&#160;Others said, “This is the Christ.” But some said, “Indeed, the
                    Christ does not come from Galilee, does he? <span class="verses">42</span>&#160;Have the scriptures
                    not said that the Christ will come from the seed of David and from Bethlehem, the village where
                    David was?” <span class="verses">43</span>&#160;So a division happened in the crowds because of him.
                    <span class="verses">44</span>&#160;But some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on
                    him.

                    trap him so that they might have something to accuse him about, but Jesus bent down and wrote on the

                    he stood up and said to them, “The one among you who has no sin, let him be the first to throw a
                    stone at her.” <span class="verses">8</span>&#160;Again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground
                    with his finger. <span class="verses">9</span>&#160;When they heard it, they left one by one,
                    beginning with the oldest. Finally Jesus was left alone, with the woman who had been in the middle.
                    <span class="verses">10</span>&#160;Jesus stood up and said to her, “Woman, where are your accusers?
                    Did no one condemn you?” <span class="verses">11</span>&#160;She said, “No one, Lord.” Jesus said,
                    “Neither do I condemn you. Go and sin no more.”]

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">12</span>&#160;Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, “I am the

                    light of life.” <span class="verses">13</span>&#160;The Pharisees said to him, “You bear witness
                    about yourself; your witness is not true.” <span class="verses">14</span>&#160;Jesus answered and
                    said to them, “Even if I would bear witness about myself, my witness is true. For I know where I
                    came from and where I am going, but you do not know where I came from or where I am going. <span

                        class="verses">22</span>&#160;Then the Jews said, “He will not kill himself, will he? Is that

                    many things to speak and to judge concerning you. But the one who sent me is true; and the things

                    speak these things. <span class="verses">29</span>&#160;And the one who sent me is with me. He has
                    not left me alone, because I always do what is pleasing to him.” <span
                        class="verses">30</span>&#160;As he is speaking these things, many believed in him.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">31</span>&#160;Then Jesus said to those Jews who had believed him,
                    “If you would remain in my word, you are truly my disciples; <span class="verses">32</span>&#160;and
                    you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” <span class="verses">33</span>&#160;They
                    replied to him, “We are the seed of Abraham and have never been slaves of anyone; how can you say,
                    ‘You will be set free’?” <span class="verses">34</span>&#160;Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I
                    say to you, that everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin. <span class="verses">35</span>&#160;But
                    the slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever. <span
                        class="verses">36</span>&#160;Therefore, if the Son sets you free, you will be truly free. <span
                        class="verses">37</span>&#160;I know that you are the seed of Abraham, but you seek to kill me
                    because my word has no place in you. <span class="verses">38</span>&#160;I say what I have seen with
                    my Father; therefore you also do what you heard from your father.” <span
                        class="verses">39</span>&#160;They answered and said to him, “Our father is Abraham.” Jesus says
                    to them, “If you were children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham. <span
                        class="verses">40</span>&#160;But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that
                    I heard from God. Abraham did not do this. <span class="verses">41</span>&#160;You do the works of
                    your father.” Then they said to him, “We have not been born from sexual immorality; we have one
                    Father: God.” <span class="verses">42</span>&#160;Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you
                    would have loved me, for I came from God and am here; for neither have I come from myself, but he
                    sent me. <span class="verses">43</span>&#160;Why do you not understand my speech? It is because you
                    are not able to hear my words. <span class="verses">44</span>&#160;You are from your father, the
                    devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. That one was a murderer from the beginning and

                    and the prophets died; but you say, ‘If anyone would keep my word, he would certainly not ever taste

                        class="verses">54</span>&#160;Jesus answered, “If I would glorify myself, my glory is nothing;
                    it is my Father who glorifies me—about whom you say that he is your God. <span
                        class="verses">55</span>&#160;And you have not known him, but I know him. And if I would say, ‘I
                    do not know him,’ I would be like you, a liar. However, I know him and keep his word. <span
                        class="verses">56</span>&#160;Your father Abraham rejoiced that he might see my day, and he saw
                    it and was glad.” <span class="verses">57</span>&#160;Therefore the Jews said to him, “You are not
                    yet 50 years old, and you have seen Abraham?” <span class="verses">58</span>&#160;Jesus said to

                        class="verses">31</span>&#160;We know that God does not hear sinners, but if someone is devout

                        class="verses">5</span>&#160;Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. <span
                        class="verses">6</span>&#160;So when he heard that he was sick, he then indeed stayed two days
                    in the place where he was. <span class="verses">7</span>&#160;Then after this, he says to the
                    disciples, “Let us go to Judea again.” <span class="verses">8</span>&#160;The disciples say to him,
                    “Rabbi, right now the Jews are seeking to stone you, and you are going back there again?” <span
                        class="verses">9</span>&#160;Jesus answered, “Are there not 12 hours in the day? If someone
                    walks in the daytime, he does not stumble, because he sees by the light of this world. <span
                        class="verses">10</span>&#160;But if someone would walk at night, he stumbles because the light
                    is not in him.” <span class="verses">11</span>&#160;He said these things, and after these things, he
                    said to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may wake him out of
                    sleep.” <span class="verses">12</span>&#160;The disciples therefore said to him, “Lord, if he has
                    fallen asleep, he will recover.” <span class="verses">13</span>&#160;But Jesus had spoken about his
                    death, but they thought that he is speaking about the rest of sleep. <span
                        class="verses">14</span>&#160;Therefore Jesus then said to them plainly, “Lazarus is dead. <span
                        class="verses">15</span>&#160;And I am glad, for your sakes, that I was not there so that you
                    may believe. But let us go to him.” <span class="verses">16</span>&#160;Then Thomas, who was called
                    Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go so that we may die with him.”</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">17</span>&#160;Therefore, having come, Jesus found him having
                    already been in the tomb for four days. <span class="verses">18</span>&#160;Now Bethany was near
                    Jerusalem, about 15 stadia away. <span class="verses">19</span>&#160;But many of the Jews had come
                    to Martha and Mary, so that they might comfort them about their brother. <span
                        class="verses">20</span>&#160;Then Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet
                    him, but Mary was sitting in the house. <span class="verses">21</span>&#160;Martha then said to
                    Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. <span
                        class="verses">22</span>&#160;But even now, I know that whatever you would ask from God, God
                    will give to you.” <span class="verses">23</span>&#160;Jesus says to her, “Your brother will rise
                    again.” <span class="verses">24</span>&#160;Martha says to him, “I know that he will rise again in
                    the resurrection on the last day.” <span class="verses">25</span>&#160;Jesus said to her, “I am the
                    resurrection and the life; the one believing in me, even if he would die, will live; <span
                        class="verses">26</span>&#160;and everyone living and believing in me may certainly not ever
                    die. Do you believe this?” <span class="verses">27</span>&#160;She says to him, “Yes, Lord, I
                    believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world.” <span
                        class="verses">28</span>&#160;And having said this, she went away and called her sister Mary
                    privately, having said, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.” <span
                        class="verses">29</span>&#160;But when she heard this, she got up quickly and went to him. <span
                        class="verses">30</span>&#160;Now Jesus had not yet come into the village but was still in the
                    place where Martha had met him. <span class="verses">31</span>&#160;So the Jews who were with her in
                    the house and comforting her, having seen that Mary got up quickly and went out, followed her,
                    having thought that she was going to the tomb so that she might weep there. <span
                        class="verses">32</span>&#160;Then when Mary came to the place where Jesus was, having seen him,
                    she fell down at his feet, saying to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have
                    died.” <span class="verses">33</span>&#160;When therefore Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews having
                    come with her weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and was troubled; <span
                        class="verses">34</span>&#160;and he said, “Where have you laid him?” They say to him, “Lord,
                    come and see.” <span class="verses">35</span>&#160;Jesus wept. <span
                        class="verses">36</span>&#160;Then the Jews said, “Behold how much he loved him!” <span
                        class="verses">37</span>&#160;But some of them said, “Was this one, who opened the eyes of the
                    blind, not able to act so that this man also would not die?” <span
                        class="verses">38</span>&#160;Then Jesus again, being deeply moved in himself, went to the tomb.
                    Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it. <span class="verses">39</span>&#160;Jesus says, “Take
                    away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the one who had died, says to him, “Lord, he will already
                    stink, for it has been four days.” <span class="verses">40</span>&#160;Jesus says to her, “Did I not
                    say to you that, if you would believe, you will see the glory of God?” <span
                        class="verses">41</span>&#160;So they took away the stone. Then Jesus lifted up his eyes and
                    said, “Father, I thank you that you listened to me. <span class="verses">42</span>&#160;But I have
                    known that you always listen, but because of the crowd that is standing around, I said this, so that
                    they may believe that you sent me.” <span class="verses">43</span>&#160;And having said this, he
                    cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” <span class="verses">44</span>&#160;The dead man
                    came out, his feet and hands having been bound with cloths, and his face having been bound with a
                    cloth. Jesus says to them, “Untie him and let him go.”</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">45</span>&#160;Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary and had
                    seen what he did, believed in him. <span class="verses">46</span>&#160;But some of them went away to
                    the Pharisees and told them the things that Jesus had done.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">47</span>&#160;Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the
                    Sanhedrin together and said, “What will we do, for this man does many signs? <span
                        class="verses">48</span>&#160;If we leave him alone like this, all will believe in him, and the
                    Romans will come and will take away from us both our place and our nation.” <span
                        class="verses">49</span>&#160;But a certain man among them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that
                    year, said to them, “You do not know anything. <span class="verses">50</span>&#160;You do not
                    consider that it is better for you that one man would die for the people, and the whole nation would
                    not perish.” <span class="verses">51</span>&#160;Now this he said not from himself, but being high
                    priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation; <span
                        class="verses">52</span>&#160;and not only for the nation, but so that also the children of God
                    who had been scattered would be gathered together into one. <span class="verses">53</span>&#160;So
                    from that day they deliberated so that they might put him to death.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">54</span>&#160;Therefore Jesus no longer walked openly among the
                    Jews, but he departed from there into the country near the wilderness, into a town called Ephraim.
                    There he stayed with the disciples. <span class="verses">55</span>&#160;Now the Passover of the Jews
                    was near, and many went up to Jerusalem from the country before the Passover so that they might
                    purify themselves. <span class="verses">56</span>&#160;So they were looking for Jesus, and speaking
                    one with another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think? That he may certainly not come to
                    the festival?” <span class="verses">57</span>&#160;Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given
                    an order so that if anyone might know where he was, he should report it so that they might seize
                    him.</div>
                <h3 class="chapter">12</h3>

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">1</span>&#160;Therefore, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to
                    Bethany, where Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the dead, was. <span
                        class="verses">2</span>&#160;So they made him a dinner there, and Martha was serving, but
                    Lazarus was one of those reclining at table with Jesus. <span class="verses">3</span>&#160;Then
                    Mary, having taken a litra of perfumed oil made of very precious pure nard, anointed the feet of
                    Jesus with it and wiped his feet with her hair. Then the house was filled with the fragrance of the
                    perfumed oil. <span class="verses">4</span>&#160;But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, the one
                    who was going to betray him, says, <span class="verses">5</span>&#160;“Why was this perfumed oil not
                    sold for 300 denarii and given to the poor?” <span class="verses">6</span>&#160;But he said this,
                    not because it was a concern to him about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the
                    moneybag, he was stealing what was put in it. <span class="verses">7</span>&#160;Therefore Jesus
                    said, “Leave her alone, because she has kept it for the day of my burial. <span
                        class="verses">8</span>&#160;For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have
                    me.”</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">9</span>&#160;Then a large crowd of the Jews learned that he is
                    there, and they came, not only for Jesus, but also so that they might see Lazarus, whom he had
                    raised from the dead. <span class="verses">10</span>&#160;But the chief priests conspired together
                    so that they might also put Lazarus to death; <span class="verses">11</span>&#160;for because of him
                    many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">12</span>&#160;On the next day a great crowd came to the festival.
                    Having heard that Jesus is coming to Jerusalem, <span class="verses">13</span>&#160;they took the
                    branches of the palm trees and went out to meet him and cried out, “Hosanna! Blessed is the one
                    coming in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.” <span class="verses">14</span>&#160;But
                    Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it; just as it is written, <span
                        class="verses">15</span>&#160;“Do not fear, daughter of Zion; behold, your King is coming,
                    sitting on the colt of a donkey.” <span class="verses">16</span>&#160;His disciples did not
                    understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these
                    things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him. <span
                        class="verses">17</span>&#160;Now the crowd testified that they had been with him when he called
                    Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him up from the dead. <span class="verses">18</span>&#160;For
                    this reason also the crowd went out to meet him, because they heard that he had done this sign.
                    <span class="verses">19</span>&#160;The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, “Look, you are
                    accompishing nothing; behold, the world has gone after him.”
                </div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">20</span>&#160;But certain Greeks were among those going up so that
                    they might worship at the festival. <span class="verses">21</span>&#160;Therefore these men went to
                    Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, saying, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.” <span
                        class="verses">22</span>&#160;Philip goes and speaks to Andrew, Andrew and Philip go and speak
                    to Jesus. <span class="verses">23</span>&#160;But Jesus answers them, saying, “The hour has come so
                    that the Son of Man might be glorified. <span class="verses">24</span>&#160;Truly, truly, I say to
                    you, unless a grain of wheat, having fallen into the earth, would die, it remains by itself; but if
                    it would die, it bears much fruit. <span class="verses">25</span>&#160;The one loving his life loses
                    it; but the one hating his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. <span
                        class="verses">26</span>&#160;If anyone would serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there
                    will my servant also be. If anyone would serve me, the Father will honor him. <span
                        class="verses">27</span>&#160;Now my soul has been troubled and what might I say? ‘Father, save
                    me from this hour’? But for this reason I came to this hour. <span
                        class="verses">28</span>&#160;Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have
                    both glorified it and I will glorify it again.” <span class="verses">29</span>&#160;Then the crowd
                    that stood by also having heard it were saying that it had thundered. Others were saying, “An angel
                    has spoken to him.” <span class="verses">30</span>&#160;Jesus answered and said, “This voice did not
                    come for me, but for you. <span class="verses">31</span>&#160;Now is the judgment of this world: Now
                    will the ruler of this world be thrown out. <span class="verses">32</span>&#160;And I, if I would be
                    lifted up from the earth, will draw everyone to myself.” <span class="verses">33</span>&#160;But he
                    was saying this to indicate what kind of death he was about to die. <span
                        class="verses">34</span>&#160;Then the crowd answered him, “We have heard from the law that the
                    Christ remains forever. And how do you say, ‘It is necessary for the Son of Man to be lifted up’?
                    Who is this Son of Man?” <span class="verses">35</span>&#160;Jesus then said to them, “The light
                    will be with you yet a short time. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness might not
                    overtake you. And the one walking in the darkness does not know where he is going. <span
                        class="verses">36</span>&#160;While you have the light, believe in the light so that you may be
                    sons of light.”</div>
                <div class="p">Jesus said these things and having departed, was hidden from them. <span

                    believing in him <span class="verses">38</span>&#160;so that the word of Isaiah the prophet would be
                    fulfilled, in which he said:</div>
                <div class="q">“Lord, who has believed our report,</div>

                <div class="m"><span class="verses">39</span>&#160;For this reason they were not able to believe, for

                <div class="m"><span class="verses">41</span>&#160;Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and

                    believed in him; but because of the Pharisees, they were not confessing it so that they would not be
                    banned from the synagogue. <span class="verses">43</span>&#160;For they loved the glory from men

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">44</span>&#160;But Jesus cried out and said, “The one believing in

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">1</span>&#160;Now before the Festival of the Passover, Jesus knew
                    that his hour had come so that he might go out from this world to the Father. Having loved his own
                    who were in the world, he loved them to the end. <span class="verses">2</span>&#160;And while supper
                    was happening, the devil had already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot son of Simon, so that he
                    might betray him. <span class="verses">3</span>&#160;He knew that the Father had given everything to
                    him, into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God. <span
                        class="verses">4</span>&#160;He gets up from dinner and takes off his outer clothing, and having
                    taken a towel, he wrapped it around himself. <span class="verses">5</span>&#160;Then he pours water
                    into a basin and began to wash the feet of the disciples and to dry them with the towel that was
                    tied around himself. <span class="verses">6</span>&#160;Then coming to Simon Peter, he says to him,
                    “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?” <span class="verses">7</span>&#160;Jesus answered and said to
                    him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand after this.” <span
                        class="verses">8</span>&#160;Peter says to him, “You may certainly not ever wash my feet.” Jesus
                    answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.” <span
                        class="verses">9</span>&#160;Simon Peter says to him, “Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands
                    and my head.” <span class="verses">10</span>&#160;Jesus says to him, “The one who has been washed
                    has no need, except to wash his feet, but he is completely clean; and you are clean, but not all.”
                    <span class="verses">11</span>&#160;(For he knew who is betraying him; for this reason he said, “Not
                    all are clean.”)

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">12</span>&#160;So when he had washed their feet and taken his

                        class="verses">13</span>&#160;You call me ‘teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and you are speaking correctly,

                    your feet, you also ought to wash the feet of one another. <span class="verses">15</span>&#160;For I
                    have given you an example so that you also would do just as I did for you. <span
                        class="verses">16</span>&#160;Truly, truly, I say to you, a slave is not greater than his

                        class="verses">18</span>&#160;I am not speaking about all of you; I know whom I have chosen—but
                    so that the scripture might be fulfilled: ‘The one eating bread with me lifted up his heel against
                    me.’ <span class="verses">19</span>&#160;Now I tell you before it happens so that when it happens,
                    you may believe that I AM. <span class="verses">20</span>&#160;Truly, truly, I say to you, the one
                    receiving whomever I sent, receives me, and the one receiving me, receives the one who sent me.”

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">21</span>&#160;Having said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and he
                    testified and said, “Truly, truly, I say to you that one of you will betray me.” <span
                        class="verses">22</span>&#160;The disciples began looking at each other, wondering about whom he
                    was speaking. <span class="verses">23</span>&#160;But one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was
                    reclining at table against the chest of Jesus. <span class="verses">24</span>&#160;Therefore Simon
                    Peter motioned to this one, “Ask him who it is about whom he is speaking.” <span
                        class="verses">25</span>&#160;So having thus leaned back against the chest of Jesus, that one
                    said to him, “Lord, who is it?” <span class="verses">26</span>&#160;Jesus answered, “It is that one
                    to whom I, having dipped the piece of bread, will hand it over and give it to him.” Then having
                    dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. <span class="verses">27</span>&#160;And
                    after the bread, when Satan entered into him, Jesus therefore says to him, “What you are doing, do
                    it quickly.” <span class="verses">28</span>&#160;But none of those reclining at table knew why he
                    said this to him. <span class="verses">29</span>&#160;For some were thinking that, since Judas had
                    the moneybag, Jesus is saying to him, “Buy what we need to have for the festival,” or so that he
                    might give something to the poor. <span class="verses">30</span>&#160;Therefore having received the
                    bread, he went out immediately. And it was night.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">31</span>&#160;Therefore, when he had gone out, Jesus says, “Now the

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">1</span>&#160;“I have spoken these things to you so that you might
                    not fall away. <span class="verses">2</span>&#160;They will throw you out of the synagogues. But the
                    hour is coming so that everyone who kills you may seem to offer a service to God. <span
                        class="verses">3</span>&#160;And they will do these things because they have not known the
                    Father nor me. <span class="verses">4</span>&#160;But I have spoken these things to you so that when
                    their hour may come, you may remember that I told you about them. But I did not tell you these
                    things in the beginning, because I was with you. <span class="verses">5</span>&#160;But now I go to
                    the one who has sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’ <span
                        class="verses">6</span>&#160;But because I have said these things to you, sadness has filled
                    your heart. <span class="verses">7</span>&#160;But I tell you the truth, it is better for you that I
                    would go away. For if I would not go away, the Comforter will not come to you. But if I would go, I
                    will send him to you. <span class="verses">8</span>&#160;And having come, the Comforter will reprove
                    the world about sin, and about righteousness, and about judgment— <span
                        class="verses">9</span>&#160;about sin, because they do not believe in me; <span
                        class="verses">10</span>&#160;but about righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will
                    no longer see me; <span class="verses">11</span>&#160;but about judgment, because the ruler of this
                    world has been judged. <span class="verses">12</span>&#160;I have many more things to say to you,
                    but you are not able to bear them now. <span class="verses">13</span>&#160;But when he, the Spirit
                    of Truth, may comes, he will guide you into the whole truth, for he will not speak from himself. But
                    he will say whatever he will hear, and he will announce to you things that are to come. <span
                        class="verses">14</span>&#160;He will glorify me, because he will take from the things of mine
                    and he will announce it to you. <span class="verses">15</span>&#160;Everything that the Father has
                    is mine. Therefore, I said that he will take from the things of mine and he will announce it to you.
                    <span class="verses">16</span>&#160;And in a little while you no longer see me, and again a little
                    while and you will see me.” <span class="verses">17</span>&#160;Then some of his disciples said to
                    one another, “What is this that he says to us, ‘A little while and you will not see me, and again a
                    little while and you will see me,’ and, ‘Because I go to the Father’?” <span
                        class="verses">18</span>&#160;Therefore they were saying, “What is this that he says, ‘A little
                    while’? We do not know what he is saying.” <span class="verses">19</span>&#160;Jesus knew that they
                    wanted to question him, and he said to them, “Are you seeking among yourselves concerning this, that
                    I said, ‘A little while and you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see me’?
                    <span class="verses">20</span>&#160;Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but
                    the world will be glad. You will be grieved, but your sorrow will turn into joy. <span
                        class="verses">21</span>&#160;When a woman gives birth she has pain because her hour has come,
                    but when she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers her suffering because of her joy
                    that a person has been born into the world. <span class="verses">22</span>&#160;And so you have
                    sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your heart will be glad, and no one takes away your joy
                    from you. <span class="verses">23</span>&#160;And in that day you will not ask me anything. Truly,
                    truly, I say to you, whatever you might ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you. <span
                        class="verses">24</span>&#160;Until now you have not asked anything in my name. Ask, and you
                    will receive so that your joy may be fulfilled.

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">25</span>&#160;I have said these things to you in figures of speech;
                    an hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but instead I will tell
                    you plainly about the Father. <span class="verses">26</span>&#160;In that day you will ask in my
                    name and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on behalf of you, <span
                        class="verses">27</span>&#160;for the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and
                    have believed that I came from God. <span class="verses">28</span>&#160;I came from the Father, and
                    I have come into the world. Again, I am leaving the world and I am going to the Father.” <span
                        class="verses">29</span>&#160;His disciples say, “See, now you are speaking plainly and you are
                    not speaking in figures of speech. <span class="verses">30</span>&#160;Now we know that you know all
                    things, and you do not have need that anyone would question you. In this we believe that you have
                    come from God.” <span class="verses">31</span>&#160;Jesus answered them, “Do you believe now? <span
                        class="verses">32</span>&#160;Behold, an hour is coming, and has come, that you might be
                    scattered, each one to his own, and you might leave me alone. Yet I am not alone because the Father
                    is with me. <span class="verses">33</span>&#160;I have spoken these things to you so that you might
                    have peace in me. In the world you have troubles, but have courage, I have conquered the world.”

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">1</span>&#160;Jesus said these things and having lifted up his eyes
                    to the heaven, he said, “Father, the hour has come, glorify your Son so that the Son might glorify
                    you— <span class="verses">2</span>&#160;just as you gave him authority over all flesh so that to
                    everyone whom you have given him, he would give them eternal life. <span
                        class="verses">3</span>&#160;But this is eternal life: That they would know you, the only true
                    God, and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ. <span class="verses">4</span>&#160;I glorified you on
                    the earth, having completed the work that you have given me so that I might do it. <span
                        class="verses">5</span>&#160;And now, Father, glorify me along with yourself with the glory that
                    I had with you before the world was made. <span class="verses">6</span>&#160;I revealed your name to
                    the men whom you gave me from the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have
                    kept your word. <span class="verses">7</span>&#160;Now they know that everything that you have given
                    me is from you, <span class="verses">8</span>&#160;for I have given them the words that you gave me,
                    and they received them and truly knew that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.
                    <span class="verses">9</span>&#160;I ask on behalf of them. I do not ask on behalf of the world but
                    on behalf of those whom you have given me, for they are yours. <span
                        class="verses">10</span>&#160;And all that is mine is yours, and what is yours is mine, and I am
                    glorified in them. <span class="verses">11</span>&#160;And I am no longer in the world, but they are
                    in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name that you have given me so
                    that they would be one, just as we are one. <span class="verses">12</span>&#160;While I was with
                    them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me. And I protected them, and not one of them
                    was destroyed, except for the son of destruction, so that the scriptures would be fulfilled. <span
                        class="verses">13</span>&#160;But now I am coming to you, and I am saying these things in the
                    world so that they would have my joy fulfilled in themselves. <span class="verses">14</span>&#160;I
                    have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not from the world, just as
                    I am not from the world. <span class="verses">15</span>&#160;I do not ask that you would take them
                    away from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one. <span
                        class="verses">16</span>&#160;They are not from the world, just as I am not from the world.
                    <span class="verses">17</span>&#160;Sanctify them by the truth. Your word is truth. <span
                        class="verses">18</span>&#160;Just as you sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the
                    world. <span class="verses">19</span>&#160;And for their sakes I have sanctified myself, so that
                    they themselves may also be sanctified in truth. <span class="verses">20</span>&#160;But I ask not
                    only on behalf of these, but also on behalf of those who will believe in me through their word <span
                        class="verses">21</span>&#160;so that they would all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and
                    I am in you, so that they also would be in us, so that the world would believe that you have sent
                    me. <span class="verses">22</span>&#160;The glory that you gave me, I also have given to them, so
                    that they would be one, just as we are one: <span class="verses">23</span>&#160;I in them, and you
                    in me—so that they may be made complete as one, so that the world may know that you sent me, and you
                    loved them just as you loved me. <span class="verses">24</span>&#160;Father, those you have given
                    me, I desire that they also may be with me where I am, in order to see my glory, which you gave me
                    because you loved me before the foundation of the world. <span
                        class="verses">25</span>&#160;Righteous Father, even the world did not know you, but I know you;
                    and these know that you sent me. <span class="verses">26</span>&#160;And I made your name known to
                    them, and I will make it known so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I
                    in them.”

                <h3 class="chapter">18</h3>
                <p class="chapN">Chapter 18</p>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">1</span>&#160;Having spoke these words, Jesus went out with his
                    disciples across the brook of the Kidron, where there was a garden into which he and his disciples
                    entered. <span class="verses">2</span>&#160;Now Judas, the one betraying him, also knew the place,
                    for Jesus often gathered there with his disciples. <span class="verses">3</span>&#160;Then Judas,
                    leading the cohort of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and from the Pharisees, comes
                    there with lanterns, and torches, and weapons. <span class="verses">4</span>&#160;Then Jesus,
                    knowing all the things happening to him, having gone out, asked them, “Who are you seeking?” <span
                        class="verses">5</span>&#160;They answered him, “Jesus the Nazarene.” He says to them, “I am.”
                    But Judas, the one betraying him, was also standing with them. <span class="verses">6</span>&#160;So
                    when he said to them, “I am,” they went backward and fell to the ground. <span
                        class="verses">7</span>&#160;Then again he asked them, “Who are you seeking?” And they said,
                    “Jesus the Nazarene.” <span class="verses">8</span>&#160;Jesus answered, “I told you that I am. So
                    if you are seeking me, allow these to go away.” <span class="verses">9</span>&#160;This was so that
                    would be fulfilled the word that he said: “Of those whom you have given me, I did not lose any of
                    them.” <span class="verses">10</span>&#160;Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the
                    servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. Now the name of the servant was Malchus. <span
                        class="verses">11</span>&#160;Then Jesus said to Peter, “Put the sword into its sheath. The cup
                    which the Father has given me, should I certainly not drink it?”</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">12</span>&#160;So the cohort of soldiers and the commander, and the
                    officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and tied him up. <span class="verses">13</span>&#160;And they led
                    him first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. <span
                        class="verses">14</span>&#160;Now Caiaphas was the one who had given the advice to the Jews that
                    it would be better that one man die on behalf of the people.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">15</span>&#160;But Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus.
                    Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the
                    high priest. <span class="verses">16</span>&#160;But Peter was standing at the door outside. So the
                    other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the female doorkeeper and he
                    brought Peter in. <span class="verses">17</span>&#160;Then the female servant, the doorkeeper, says
                    to Peter, “Are you not also from the disciples of this man?” He says, “I am not.” <span
                        class="verses">18</span>&#160;Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made
                    a charcoal fire, for it was cold, and they were warming themselves. But Peter was also with them,
                    standing there and warming himself.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">19</span>&#160;The high priest then asked Jesus about his disciples
                    and about his teaching. <span class="verses">20</span>&#160;Jesus answered him, “I have spoken
                    openly to the world. I was always teaching in the synagogue and in the temple where all the Jews
                    come together, and I said nothing in secret. <span class="verses">21</span>&#160;Why do you ask me?
                    Ask those who heard what I said to them. Behold, these people know what I said.” <span
                        class="verses">22</span>&#160;Now when he had said this, one of the officers standing there gave
                    Jesus a slap, saying, “Do you answer the high priest in this manner?” <span
                        class="verses">23</span>&#160;Jesus answered him, “If I spoke wrongly, testify about the wrong,
                    but if rightly, why do you strike me?” <span class="verses">24</span>&#160;Then Annas sent him tied
                    up to Caiaphas the high priest.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">25</span>&#160;Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself.
                    Then they said to him, “Are you not also from his disciples?” He denied it and said, “I am not.”
                    <span class="verses">26</span>&#160;One of the servants of the high priest, who was a relative of
                    the one whose ear Peter had cut off, says, “Did I not see you in the garden with him?” <span
                        class="verses">27</span>&#160;Peter then denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed.
                </div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">28</span>&#160;Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor’s
                    palace. But it was early in the morning, and they did not enter into the governor’s palace so that
                    they would not be defiled but might eat the Passover. <span class="verses">29</span>&#160;So Pilate
                    went out to them and says, “What accusation are you bringing against this man?” <span
                        class="verses">30</span>&#160;They answered and said to him, “If this man was not an evildoer,
                    we would not have handed him over to you.” <span class="verses">31</span>&#160;Pilate therefore said
                    to them, “Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.” The Jews said to him, “It is
                    not lawful for us to put anyone to death.” <span class="verses">32</span>&#160;This was so that the
                    word of Jesus would be fulfilled which he had spoken to indicate by what kind of death he was about
                    to die.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">33</span>&#160;Then Pilate entered into the governor’s palace again
                    and summoned Jesus and said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” <span
                        class="verses">34</span>&#160;Jesus answered, “Do you speak this from yourself, or did others
                    speak to you about me?” <span class="verses">35</span>&#160;Pilate answered, “I am not a Jew, am I?
                    Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me. What did you do?” <span
                        class="verses">36</span>&#160;Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom
                    were from this world, my servants would fight so that I would not be handed over to the Jews. But
                    now my kingdom is not from here.” <span class="verses">37</span>&#160;Pilate then said to him, “So
                    then, are you a king?” Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for
                    this I have come into the world, so that I would bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is from the
                    truth listens to my voice.” <span class="verses">38</span>&#160;Pilate says to him, “What is truth?”
                    And having said this, he went out again to the Jews and says to them, “I find no guilt in this man.
                    <span class="verses">39</span>&#160;But there is the custom to you that I would release one person
                    to you at the Passover. So do you desire that I would release the King of the Jews to you?” <span
                        class="verses">40</span>&#160;Then they cried out again, saying, “Not this man, but Barabbas.”
                    Now Barabbas was a robber.

                    <span class="verses">2</span>&#160;And the soldiers twisted together a crown from thorns. They put
                    it on his head and put a purple garment on him. <span class="verses">3</span>&#160;And they came to
                    him and said, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and they began giving him slaps to the face. <span
                        class="verses">4</span>&#160;Pilate went outside again and says to them, “See, I am bringing him
                    outside to you so that you might know that I find no guilt in him.” <span
                        class="verses">5</span>&#160;So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple
                    garment. And he says to them, “Behold the man!” <span class="verses">6</span>&#160;When therefore
                    the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, “Crucify him, crucify him!”
                    Pilate says to them, “Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no guilt in him.” <span
                        class="verses">7</span>&#160;The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and according to the law he
                    ought to die because he made himself to be the Son of God.” <span class="verses">8</span>&#160;When
                    therefore Pilate heard this statement, he became even more afraid, <span
                        class="verses">9</span>&#160;and he entered into the governor’s palace again and says to Jesus,
                    “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer. <span class="verses">10</span>&#160;Then Pilate
                    says to him, “Are you not speaking to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you, and
                    I have authority to crucify you?” <span class="verses">11</span>&#160;Jesus answered him, “You do
                    not have any authority over me except for what has been given to you from above. Therefore, he who
                    gave me over to you has a greater sin.” <span class="verses">12</span>&#160;At this, Pilate sought
                    to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, “If you release this man, you are not a friend of
                    Caesar. Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.” <span
                        class="verses">13</span>&#160;Therefore, Pilate, having heard these words, brought Jesus out and
                    sat down in the judgment seat in a place called “The Pavement,” but in Hebrew, “Gabbatha.” <span
                        class="verses">14</span>&#160;Now it was the day of preparation of the Passover. It was about
                    the sixth hour. And he says to the Jews, “Behold your king!” <span class="verses">15</span>&#160;But
                    they cried out, “Take him away, take him away; crucify him!” Pilate says to them, “Should I crucify
                    your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king except Caesar.” <span
                        class="verses">16</span>&#160;Therefore he then handed him over to them so that he might be
                    crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away.
                </div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">17</span>&#160;And he went out, carrying the cross for himself, to

                        class="verses">18</span>&#160;They crucified him there, and with him two other men, on this side
                    and on that side, and Jesus in the middle. <span class="verses">19</span>&#160;But Pilate also wrote
                    a title and put it on the cross. But on it was written: JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
                    <span class="verses">20</span>&#160;Therefore, many of the Jews read this title because the place
                    where Jesus was crucified was near the city. And it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.
                    <span class="verses">21</span>&#160;Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not
                    write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but rather, ‘This one said, “I am King of the Jews.”’” <span
                        class="verses">22</span>&#160;Pilate answered, “What I have written I have written.”

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">23</span>&#160;Then, when the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took
                    his clothes and divided them into four shares, one share for each soldier; and the tunic. Now the
                    tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top. <span class="verses">24</span>&#160;Then they
                    said to each other, “We should not tear it, but instead we should cast lots for it, whose it will
                    be.” This happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled which says,</div>
                <div class="q">“They divided my garments among themselves</div>
                <div class="q">and cast lots for my clothing.”</div>
                <div class="m">Therefore, the soldiers did this. <span class="verses">25</span>&#160;Now standing beside

                    Magdalene. <span class="verses">26</span>&#160;Then Jesus, having seen his mother and the disciple
                    whom he loved standing nearby, says to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!” <span
                        class="verses">27</span>&#160;Then he says to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">28</span>&#160;After this, Jesus, knowing that everything was

                        class="verses">30</span>&#160;When therefore Jesus had taken the sour wine, he said, “It is
                    finished.” And having bowed his head, he gave up his spirit.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">31</span>&#160;Then the Jews, because it was the day of preparation,
                    so that the bodies would not remain on the cross during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was an
                    especially important day), asked Pilate so that their legs would be broken and they would be taken
                    away. <span class="verses">32</span>&#160;Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man
                    and of the other one who had been crucified with him. <span class="verses">33</span>&#160;But having
                    come to Jesus, as they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. <span
                        class="verses">34</span>&#160;However, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and
                    immediately blood and water came out. <span class="verses">35</span>&#160;And the one who saw this
                    has testified, and his testimony is true. And he knows that he is speaking the truth, so that you
                    would also believe. <span class="verses">36</span>&#160;For these things happened in order that the
                    scripture would be fulfilled, “Not one of his bones will be broken.” <span
                        class="verses">37</span>&#160;And again, another scripture says, “They will look at him whom

                <div class="p"><span class="verses">38</span>&#160;But after these things, Joseph who was from
                    Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus (but secretly for fear of the Jews), asked Pilate that he might
                    take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body.
                    <span class="verses">39</span>&#160;But Nicodemus also came, who at first had come to him by night,
                    bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about 100 litras in weight. <span
                        class="verses">40</span>&#160;So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with
                    the spices, just as was the custom of the Jews to bury bodies. <span
                        class="verses">41</span>&#160;Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in
                    the garden, new tomb in which no one had yet been buried. <span
                        class="verses">42</span>&#160;Therefore, because of the day of preparation for the Jews and
                    because the tomb was close by, they laid Jesus there.

                    then the other disciple, the one who first arrived at the tomb, also went in, and he saw and

                        class="verses">12</span>&#160;Jesus says to them, “Come, eat breakfast.” But none of the
                    disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?” They knew that it was the Lord. <span
                        class="verses">13</span>&#160;Jesus comes and takes the bread and gives it to them, and the fish
                    in the same way. <span class="verses">14</span>&#160;This was now the third time that Jesus showed
                    himself to the disciples, having been raised from the dead.</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">15</span>&#160;Then when they ate breakfast, Jesus says to Simon
                    Peter, “Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?” he says to him, “Yes Lord, you know that
                    I love you.” He says to him, “Feed my lambs.” <span class="verses">16</span>&#160;He says to him
                    again a second time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?” He says to him, “Yes Lord, you know that I
                    love you.” He says to him, “Take care of my sheep.”</div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">17</span>&#160;He says to him a third time, “Simon son of John, do
                    you love me?” Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, “Do you love me?” And he says
                    to him, “Lord, you know all things, you know that I love you.” Jesus says to him, “Feed my sheep.
                    <span class="verses">18</span>&#160;Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to
                    clothe yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you become old, you will stretch out your
                    hands, and another will clothe you and carry you where you do not want.” <span
                        class="verses">19</span>&#160;Now he said this to indicate with what kind of death he will
                    glorify God. And having said this, he says to him, “Follow me.” <span
                        class="verses">20</span>&#160;Having turned around, Peter sees the disciple whom Jesus loved
                    following them, the one who also leaned back against his chest at the dinner and said, “Lord, who is
                    the one betraying you?” <span class="verses">21</span>&#160;Therefore having seen him, Peter says to
                    Jesus, “But Lord, what about this man?” <span class="verses">22</span>&#160;Jesus says to him, “If I
                    want him to stay until I come, what is that to you? You follow me.” <span
                        class="verses">23</span>&#160;So this word spread among the brothers, that that disciple does
                    not die. But Jesus did not say to him that he does not die, but, “If I want him to stay until I
                    come, what is that to you?”
                </div>
                <div class="p"><span class="verses">24</span>&#160;This is the disciple who testifies about these
                    things, and who wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true. <span
                        class="verses">25</span>&#160;But there are also many other things that Jesus did, which, if
                    each one were written down, I suppose that not even the world itself would have enough room for the
                    books being written.</div>
